# Structured Light Depth-Acquisition  

Matlab Implementation of a 3D Reconstruction algorithm, based (High Accuracy Stereo Depth Maps Using Structured Light)[http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~schar/papers/structlight/structlight.pdf], by Daniel Scharstein and Richard Szeliski.  

The full algorithm can be found in the `RECONSTRUCTION.m` Matlab file.
